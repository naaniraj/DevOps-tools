-- exus is a repository manager that helps store, manage, and share software packages and artifacts.

-- Think of it like a warehouse where developers keep all the software components
(like code libraries, dependencies, or Docker images) in one place. It makes it easy to store, retrieve,
and share these components so that teams can work efficiently and avoid downloading from the internet every time.

-- Itâ€™s mostly used in DevOps to manage dependencies and speed up software development.
