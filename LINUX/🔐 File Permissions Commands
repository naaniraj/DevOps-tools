What are Permissions?
Permissions decide who can read, write, or run a file.

Example of permission:
-rwxr-xr--

Breakdown:

First character: - means file, d means directory

rwx: Owner can read, write, execute

r-x: Group can read, execute

r--: Others can read only

Commands
Command	What it Does
chmod 755 file	Changes permission (explained below)
chown user file	Changes the owner of the file
chgrp group file	Changes the group of the file
ðŸŽ¯ Permission Numbers (Shortcuts)
r = 4, w = 2, x = 1

Add them together:

7 = rwx (read, write, execute)

6 = rw- (read, write)

5 = r-x (read, execute)

4 = r-- (read only)

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod 755 file
Means:

Owner: 7 â†’ rwx

Group: 5 â†’ r-x

Others: 5 â†’ r-x
