## What does Kubernetes do?
***********************************************
Automatically runs your app – If a part of your app crashes, Kubernetes restarts it.

Scales up or down – If more customers (users) come, Kubernetes adds more chefs (resources). 
                    If fewer come, it reduces them.

Manages updates – If you need to change the app (like adding a new dish to the menu),
                  Kubernetes smoothly updates without shutting everything down.

Distributes traffic – If one chef is busy, it sends the order to another, making sure no one is overloaded.

Kubernetes is mainly used with Docker or other container technologies.
It helps companies like Google, Netflix, and Amazon run massive applications smoothly.
