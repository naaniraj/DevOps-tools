Prometheus is a monitoring tool that helps track the performance and health of servers, applications, and other systems.

It works by collecting and storing metrics (like CPU usage, memory, network traffic, etc.) 
from different sources and then allowing you to analyze and alert when something goes wrong.

Think of it like a security camera for your IT systemsâ€”it continuously watches, records data,
and alerts you if something unusual happens. It is often used with Grafana to visualize the collected data in dashboards.
