What is SONAR-QUBE ?
*********************************************

SonarQube is a code quality and security tool that helps developers write better and safer code.
It works by scanning your code to find bugs, security issues, and bad coding practices,
then gives you suggestions to fix them ,
Think of it like a grammar checker for your codeâ€”it helps make sure your code is clean, 
secure, and follows best practices before you release it.
