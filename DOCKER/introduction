  What is DOCKER ?
******************************
Docker is a tool that helps you build, package, and run applications easily. Think of it like a container
that holds everything your application needs—code, libraries, and dependencies—so it runs the same way everywhere,
whether on your laptop, a server, or in the cloud.

Just like a shipping container that can be moved from one place to another
without worrying about what's inside, Docker ensures your application works the same way, no matter where you run it.
