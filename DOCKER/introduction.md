## What is DOCKER ?
******************************
Docker is a tool that helps you build, package, and run applications easily.  it like a container
that holds everything your application needs—code, libraries, and dependencies—so it runs the same way everywhere,
whether on your laptop, a server, or in the cloud.

Just like a shipping container that can be moved from one place to another
without worrying about what's inside, Docker ensures your application works the same way, no matter where you run it.

### 1. 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿? 
*******************************
 Docker is a platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight,
 portable containers, easing the software deployment process.

### 2 .What is a container?
**********************************
A container is an isolated environment that packages an application and all its dependencies, 
ensuring it runs consistently across different environments

### 3 .What is the difference between a container and a virtual machine?
*******************************************************************
 1 - resouce utalization ----  Containers are more lightweight than virtual machines because they share the host system’s kernel,
                                while virtual machines have their own separate operating systems. (V / M) -- its have full fledge operation system 
                                and hyper version ,making then more resouce-intensive .
                                
 2 - portabulity ------------- containers disigend for to portable for run any operating system with compatable host operating system 
                               ( V / M) -- are less portable as they need .

 3 - Security  --------------  containers provide less isolation as per share the operating system 
                               ( V / M ) --  provide higher level security as each V/M have a own operating system 
                               and it can be isolated from other host and other V/M

 4 - management ------------- managing  containers are easy then managing v/m  we can use whare ever you want .
