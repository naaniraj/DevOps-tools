Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code. 
It is mainly used by developers to manage projects, 
collaborate with teams, and keep track of different versions of their work.

 ✅ Why Use Git?
**********************************************
* Tracks Changes – Saves every update you make to your code.
* Collaboration – Multiple people can work on the same project.
* Backup & Recovery – You can go back to an older version if needed.
* Branching – Work on new features without affecting the main project.
