## - Key Characteristics of Ansible Architecture

1. agentless:---> Ansible doesnâ€™t require agents or daemons on managed nodes, reducing overhead and simplifying setup.
2. Push-Based:--> The control node pushes configurations and commands to managed nodes, unlike pull-based systems like Puppet or Chef.
3. Modular:-----> Ansible uses modules to perform tasks, which are executed on managed nodes and return results to the control node.
4. Idempotent:--> Ansible ensures that repeated executions of the same task produce the same result, preventing unintended changes.
5. Inventory-Driven:--> Ansible relies on an inventory file to define the hosts it manages.
6. YAML-Based:--------> Playbooks, which define automation tasks, are written in human-readable YAML
